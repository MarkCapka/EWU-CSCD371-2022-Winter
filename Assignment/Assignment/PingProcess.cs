//Test and implement PingProcess.RunAsync(System.IProgress<T> progess) so that you can capture the output as it occurs rather than capturing the output only when the process finishes. ❌✔
//Fundamentals
//Ensure you enable:
//nullable reference types is enabled ❌✔
//net6 targeted ❌✔
//C# 10.0 ❌✔
//and enabled.NET analyzers for both projects ❌✔
//All of the above should be unit tested ❌✔
